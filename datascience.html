								<h2>What is Data Science?</h2>
								<p>Data science is discovering useful information from data using different tools. We’ll jump into the types of tools latter. The journal of data science described data science as “almost everything that has something to do with data: collecting analyzing, modeling... Yet the most important part is its applications”. So in 2010 the new abundance of data made it possible to train machines with a data driven approach rather than a knowledge driven approach which affected our everyday life. Analyzing and data and using it to your own advantage is the main aim of a data scientist. Being a good data scientist is all about how much impact you can have. A data scientist is more like a problem solver for companies, guiding the company into the right direction by analyzing their data.

								<h2>History:</h2>
								<p>William S.Clevend brought data science into life, he combined computer science and data mining by making statistics more technical, now you can take advantage of computer for statistics. The rise of big data in 2010 led to the rise of data science to support the needs of the big businesses.</p>
